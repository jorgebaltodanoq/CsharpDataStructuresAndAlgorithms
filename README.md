### About of books
In this course, I'll teach you the Structured Query Language—SQL for short—the fast and easy way. We'll download and use the free trial version of Microsoft SQL Server and I'll teach you exactly how to use it like a pro. Databases are incredibly important in our modern world, and they remain a mystery to most people. But they're easy to use if you know just a few things...and I'll teach you those things in this course.

We'll start out by learning fundamental database concepts, such as: What is a database, What is a table, What are rows and columns, and What are data types? After that, I'll show you how to set up and use Microsoft SQL Server.
